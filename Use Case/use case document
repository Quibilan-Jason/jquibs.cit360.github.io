Introduction
	While Use Case Diagrams are a good starting point and may be of interest to management or stakeholders, the development team will find more value in a Use Case Document. The basic difference between these two is that Use Case Diagrams are visual and serve as a sort of basic outline, while Use Case Documents delve into more detail.  The Use Case Document is a business document which provides a story of how a system, and its actors, will be utilized to achieve a specific goal. An effective Use Case should provide a detailed step-by-step description of how the system will be used by its actors to achieve the planned outcome. The purpose of the Use Case is to tie the business needs of the system to the design parameters of the system to ensure that the completed system achieves the goals established by the business requirements. The level of detail in Use Cases may vary greatly depending on the size and complexity of the system being designed.

Use Case Contents
	- Use case formats and contents may vary based on system requirements, organizational standards, or unique situations.

Use case description detail	What the detail means and why it is useful
Related Requirements	Some indication as to which requirements this use case partially or completely fulfills
Goal In Context	The use case’s place within the system and why this use case is important
Preconditions	What needs to happen before the use case can be executed
Successful End Condition	What the system’s condition should be if the use case executes successfully
Failed End Condition	What the system’s condition should be if the use case fails to execute successfully
Primary Actors	The main actors that participate in the use case. Often includes the actors that trigger or directly receive information from a use case’s execution
Secondary Actors	Actors that participate but are not the main players in a use case’s execution
Trigger	The event triggered by an actor that causes the use case to execute
Main Flow	The place to describe each of the important steps in a use case’s normal execution
Extensions	A description of any alternative steps from the ones described in the Main Flow.
